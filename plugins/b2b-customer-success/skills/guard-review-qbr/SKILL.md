  Prepare structured QBR and EBR materials using the GUARD Framework's
  7-section template. Use when a CSM mentions QBR, quarterly business review,
  EBR, executive business review, business review prep, QBR deck, value recap,
  or says things like "what should I present to the customer", "preparing for
  our quarterly review", "need a QBR brief", "post-QBR recap email", "QBR
  for an at-risk account", or "first QBR after onboarding". Accepts messy
  notes, previous QBR data, CRM exports, or conversational context and produces
  review-ready materials. Created by Shashwat Ghosh, Cofounder & Fractional

# GUARD Review — QBR/EBR Preparation

## Section 0 — Operating Principles (MANDATORY)

Read `references/input-rules.md` BEFORE executing any workflow step. Rules: One Dump principle, Question Budget of 2, Score What You Have, Column Mapping, Risk Signal Detection, No LLMisms. Consult `references/cs-metrics-glossary.md` when CS terminology (NRR, GRR, CES, health score, time-to-value, expansion ARR) needs definition or the CSM is new to the metric.

## Golden Rule

A QBR that hides bad news destroys credibility. Every QBR must include Section 5 (Risk & Mitigation) even for healthy accounts. Lead with value (what worked), then address risks transparently, then close with a forward plan. Never skip risks. Never sugar-coat. The customer already knows what is broken — your job is to show you know it too and have a plan.

## Context and Role Detection

| Persona | Output Adaptation |
|---|---|
| IC CSM | Full 7-section QBR brief + talking points + slide outline |
| CS Manager | QBR quality review template, coaching points for team |
| VP/Head of CS | QBR summary across portfolio, themes, and risk patterns |

## Priority Framework

1. Run Gauge first if health context is not available. Never prep a QBR blind.
2. Audience determines depth: C-suite gets strategic (20 min), ops lead gets tactical (45 min).
3. At-risk QBRs lead with risks and recovery plan, NOT expansion.
4. QBR prep should take under 30 minutes with this skill. If longer, the skill is failing.

## Trigger Phrases

- "QBR", "quarterly business review", "EBR", "executive business review"
- "business review prep", "QBR deck", "review meeting"
- "value recap", "what to present to customer"
- "QBR for at-risk account", "QBR with C-suite"
- "post-QBR recap", "QBR follow-up email", "QBR action items"
- "first QBR", "90-day review"

## Workflow Steps

**Step 1: Accept input and extract signals.**
Accept whatever the CSM provides — conversational brief, CRM paste, messy notes from the quarter, uploaded PDF of previous QBR (surgical extraction: exec summary + action items + risks only), or MoM from past meetings. Run Gauge inline if no health data is available.

**Step 2: Determine QBR type.**
- Standard QBR (ops lead) → Full 7 sections, data-driven, 30-45 min
- Executive Business Review (C-suite) → Strategic framing, Sections 1,2,5,7 emphasized, 20-30 min
- At-Risk QBR → Lead with Section 5, replace Section 6 with Recovery Plan
- First QBR (90-day mark) → Emphasize onboarding completion, establish baseline

**Step 3: Build the QBR.**
Apply `references/qbr-structure.md`:
1. Partnership Summary — timeline, milestones, stakeholder map update
2. Value Delivered — outcomes mapped to original business case
3. Product Adoption — hero feature + untapped feature identification
4. Support & Satisfaction — ticket trends, NPS/CSAT, open escalations
5. Risk & Mitigation — proactive flags with proposed actions (NEVER skip)
6. Growth Opportunities — natural expansion moments (skip if at-risk)
7. Forward Plan — next quarter objectives, action items, success metrics

**Step 4: Produce output based on request.**
- QBR brief (narrative prose — the default)
- QBR talking points (bullet cheat sheet for the meeting)
- QBR slide outline (section headers + key points per slide)
- Post-QBR recap email (summary + action items, send within 24h)

## Output Format

**QBR Brief (default):**
```
GUARD QBR Brief: [Account Name]
ARR: [$$] | Renewal: [date] | Health: [score/100, classification]
QBR Type: [Standard/Executive/At-Risk/First]
Audience: [who will attend]

1. PARTNERSHIP SUMMARY
   [Relationship timeline, key milestones since last QBR]

2. VALUE DELIVERED
   [Outcomes mapped to business case, quantified wins]

3. PRODUCT ADOPTION
   Hero Feature: [feature driving most value]
   Untapped Value: [biggest stickiness/expansion opportunity]
   [Adoption % and trends]

4. SUPPORT & SATISFACTION
   [Ticket trends, NPS/CSAT, open escalations]

5. RISK & MITIGATION
   [Proactive flags with proposed actions — NEVER empty]

6. GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES
   [Natural expansion moments based on usage patterns]

7. FORWARD PLAN
   Next Quarter Objectives:
     [Mutual commitments, not one-sided]
   Action Items:
     [Who] — [What] — [By when]
```

**Post-QBR Recap Email:**
```
Subject: [Account Name] QBR Recap — [Date]

Hi [Name],

Thank you for [today's/yesterday's] review. Here's a summary of what
we covered and the commitments we made:

Key Wins This Quarter:
  [1-2 sentences on value delivered]

Action Items:
  [Owner] — [Task] — [Deadline]

Risks We're Addressing:
  [1-2 sentences, transparent]

Next Steps:
  [Specific next meeting/milestone]

[CSM signature]
```

## Edge Case Handling

- **QBR with no data:** Produce the structure with `[CSM to add: X]` placeholders. The structure itself is valuable even without data.
- **At-risk QBR + expansion pressure from management:** Do NOT pitch expansion in an at-risk QBR. State this explicitly if asked.
- **First QBR at Day 90:** Frame around onboarding success, not performance gaps. The baseline is being established, not evaluated.
- **CSM inherited the account mid-cycle:** Acknowledge the transition. Use whatever history is available, flag gaps.

## Anti-Hallucination Rules

- NEVER fabricate metrics, ROI numbers, or support ticket data.
- NEVER produce a QBR that skips Section 5 (Risk & Mitigation).
- NEVER invent "customer quotes" or attribute statements the customer did not make.
- NEVER say "everything is on track" without evidence for each dimension.
